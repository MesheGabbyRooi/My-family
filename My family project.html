<h2> <p style ="text-align:justify;"> My name is Meshé Gabby Rooi and this is the story of my family. </p>

<p>
My family consists of seven people which includes my mom, dad, two brothers and two sisters and myself. Oh, and of course our eight dogs.  Each of us have our own unique characteristics, we each like things a certain way and are very fussy.
Last weekend we went to a guest house at a holiday resort. It was so much fun ! My siblings and I swam, played mini golf and tried a few rounds of tennis while mom and dad enjoyed
sipping on a cup of tea on the patio of the guest house, staring at the view of the ocean and speaking about future plans to go on a boat cruise.
I mostly likely won't take part in the boat cruise as I am afraid of the ocean. We are all very competitive and like to challenge each other frequently.

Last week we had a compeition to see who could eat the most cookies. The results are tabulated as follows: 
<!-- A table -->
<table style = width : 100%> 
<tr>	<th>Contestant Name</th>
	<th>No. of cookies eaten</th>
</tr>

<tr>
	<td>Mom</td>
	<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Dad</td>
	<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>John</td>
	<td>14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Matthew</td>
	<td>25</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Mary</td>
	<td>12</td>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Elizabeth</td>
	<td>8</td>
</tr>

<tr>

	<td>Me</td>
	<td>7</td>
</tr>
</table>




Here is a photograph of my family in the forest of the holiday resort. I've also inserted an image of my eight dogs, namely:
